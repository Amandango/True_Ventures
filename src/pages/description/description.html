                <p> Check out my blog to see how I view the world. A snippet:</p>

                <p><i>“For a little while now, I’ve been looking for magic. It hasn’t been a difficult quest: I’ve discovered that
                    it appears everywhere, even in the most unlikely places. It’s in the sound of the subway door hissing
                    shut behind you. It’s in the brown paper bag you bought from that cute cafe for breakfast, that you unwrap
                    on a park bench. It’s in the maniacal giggle that comes over you at 3am when you’re three coffees in
                    and still have pages of essay left to write. It’s at the bottom of the tea cup you sip absent-mindedly
                    as you thumb through a book. It’s in the smile from the cashier, the rueful grin of others waiting beside
                    you in a long queue, the ache in your shoulders from carrying your life in a small backpack. It’s in
                    the late night bus ride with the skyscrapers behind you, and in the cooling of the sand under your feet
                    as dusk sneaks in.”</i>

                <p> If I were to pick a superpower, I would say it is making other people feel understood. This means people
                        often come to me to , and means I find myself facilitating interactions to communicate messages between
                        people. Check out my manifesto on community and the initiatives I've created from it.</p>
